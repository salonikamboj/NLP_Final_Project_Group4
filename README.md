# NLP_Final_Project_Group4

## Overview
This project focuses on building, fine-tuning, and comparing models to classify text as human-written or AI-generated.
We implemented both:
* A baseline classic machine learning model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)
* A fine-tuned Transformer model (DistilBERT) using Hugging Face’s Transformers library
* The project includes full code, analysis, and a final report covering evaluation, error analysis, and ethical considerations.

## Repository Structure
```
├── NLP baseline model.ipynb     # Baseline model (Logistic Regression + TF-IDF)
├── NLP fine-tuned model.ipynb   # Fine-tuned DistilBERT implementation
├── Project Plan.pdf            # Initial project planning document
├── Final Project Report.pdf    # Complete project report with results & analysis
└── README.md                   # Project documentation (this file)
```

## How to Run the Notebooks

* Download and upload either NLP baseline model.ipynb or NLP fine-tuned model.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

* Make sure to enable GPU runtime if you are running the fine-tuned model (in Colab: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU).

* Run all cells in order (Kernel → Restart & Run All in Jupyter, or Runtime → Run all in Colab).
